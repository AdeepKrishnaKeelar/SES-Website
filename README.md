Sampaje Education Society - Sampaje Composite PU College and High School website.

Semi-responsive website, pardon for any bugs and errors.

Created by - Adeep Krishna Keelar, Ananya Mathur, Athmeeya M, Chandan Kumar H.G and Haricharan (NIE 5th semester) 

Updates will be done regularly. Next planned update - improved content, more js-based interaction, introduction of back-end database and more.

All images and videos belong to Sampaje Composite PU College and High School, except for the menu and closing icon from the net. 

Short-term plan to have the site on FireBase.

Please send me any feedback, suggestions, criticism... This is my first ever serious site and I, not being a very enthusiastic web-developer, have put my effort, so I shall be, like always, open to all. 

Thanks and Cheers
